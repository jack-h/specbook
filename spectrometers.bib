	Abstract = {We have developed a novel wideband spectrometer for astronomical heterodyne spectroscopy. The spectrometer, WASP, has 3250 MHz bandwidth and 33 MHz resolution, a combination well matched to submillimeter spectroscopy of high-redshift objects, interacting galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and planetary atmospheres. The spectrometer is an autocorrelation spectrometer with analog microwave integrated circuit multipliers separated by microstripline transmission line delays. Our prototype spectrometer is compact, requires little power (75 W), and integrates stably for many hours.},

  abstract={Dual sideband (2SB) receivers are well suited for the spectral observation of complex astronomical signals over a wide frequency range. They are extensively used in radio astronomy, their main advantages being to avoid spectral confusion and to diminish effective system temperature by a factor 2 with respect to double sideband (DSB) receivers. Using available millimeter-wave analog technology, wideband 2SB receivers generally obtain sideband rejection ratios (SRR) of 10-15 dB, insufficient for a number of astronomical applications. We report here the design and implementation of an FPGA-based sideband separating FFT spectrometer. A 4 GHz analog front end was built to test the design and measure sideband rejection. The setup uses a 2SB front end architecture, except that the mixer outputs are directly digitized before the IF hybrid, using two 8 bit ADCs sampling at 1 GSPS. The IF hybrid is implemented on the FPGA together with a set of calibration vectors that, properly chosen, compensate for the analog front end amplitude and phase imbalances. The calibrated receiver exhibits a sideband rejection ratio in excess of 40 dB for the entire 2 GHz RF bandwidth.}

abstract = {The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is launching the Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing

Instrument (GUPPI), a prototype flexible digital signal processor designed for pulsar observations with the Robert C.

Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). GUPPI uses field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware and design tools

developed by the Center for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER) at the University of

California, Berkeley. The NRAO has been concurrently developing GUPPI software and hardware using minimal

software resources. The software handles instrument monitor and control, data acquisition, and hardware interfacing.

GUPPI is currently an expert-only spectrometer, but supports future integration with the full GBT production system.

The NRAO was able to take advantage of the unique flexibility of the CASPER FPGA hardware platform, develop

hardware and software in parallel, and build a suite of software tools for monitoring, controlling, and acquiring data with

a new instrument over a short timeline of just a few months. The NRAO interacts regularly with CASPER and its users,

and GUPPI stands as an example of what reconfigurable computing and open-source development can do for radio

astronomy. GUPPI is modular for portability, and the NRAO provides the results of development as an open-source resource.},
